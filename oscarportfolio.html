I learned a lot of new things and experimented with several new art forms. This class overall was challenging for me, but it was very rewarding to be able to develop new skills in programs that I had little to no experience with. As an art major, it is important to be able to work in a variety of mediums, and being as connected to the Internet as I am, it is vital that I learn how to work digitally. The skills I learned in this class will be extremely important in my future career as an artist, whether I decide to continue traditional work or branch out into more modern and digital media to best suit my path online.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 10.67px solid #20124d; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 708.50px; height: 916.88px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 708.50px; height: 916.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Project One</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">Vector Graphics</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Proposal:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">For my design for the planetarium logo, I want to incorporate blue and gold to represent the university&rsquo;s school colors. This will also provide interesting contrast in the logo and make it more visually engaging. Since I am working with themes of space and the cosmos, it could be interesting to incorporate sharp, star-shaped lettering. This will also help bring forward the strong color contrast and create something eye-catching. Some movement in the logo could also be interesting, maybe having it follow a swirled pattern, like a galaxy. Another interesting concept could be to make certain letters like the O&rsquo;s in the shape of planets to represent the solar system. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">I looked at various logos for planetariums, and I found inspiration in the fact that most of them follow the shape of a dome. Pinterest was particularly helpful in helping me brainstorm ideas. In &nbsp;particular, the board of logos from Maine that was posted to Brightspace helped me come up with places to start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">I will find color palettes using blue and yellow that are particularly appealing or eye-catching, and I will incorporate them into my design. After sketching out some possible ideas, either on paper or digitally, I will experiment with Adobe Illustrator to help me visualize some typography ideas. I will create multiple variations of this logo, and then go forward with my favorite, then creating different variations on that one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Preliminary Sketches!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 399.00px; height: 249.87px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 399.00px; height: 249.87px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 402.69px; height: 251.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 402.69px; height: 251.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">The Final Product:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 671.00px; height: 376.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 864.00px; height: 376.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">My Statement:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">This project was certainly not my favorite that I have done. Looking back, I feel like I could have done a lot more and put some more effort and thought into it. I wanted something that would reflect the colors and theme of USM, and I feel like I did a good job with the color scheme. I wanted something that brought in both themes of space and the University of Southern Maine, and I incorporated them in with the shape of a galaxy, the star in the middle, and even the moon-shaped spaces in certain letters, and also the logo in the star. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Project Two</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">Photo Manipulation</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Proposal:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">For this experiment, I would like to incorporate images of my cats into a fantasy world. I have lots of photos of my cats and lots of photos of forests and landscapes. I would like to create fantasy creatures out of my cats, perhaps superimposing their heads and tails onto photos of knights and other people in warrior costumes. I would like to place them in a landscape, preferably one that evokes high fantasy imagery such as a forest. A consistent color palette could work nicely, but black and white would also look interesting as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Some elements of design I would like to incorporate into this project would be proportion, emphasis, movement, and empty space. Utilizing these elements would create an illusion of action and tension. This would help keep the piece engaging and create a fantasy atmosphere. It would also be interesting to bring color, space, and shape into this project. I would do this by using a specific color palette, bringing space between the subjects of the work, and creating strong silhouettes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">My inspiration for this project would be a combination of fantasy illustrations and album covers and band photoshoots, particularly in the heavy metal genre. I have been working with this concept in my free time, combining black metal aesthetics with cat-human hybrids. I think it would be interesting to bring this concept into a new medium, as I have been primarily working with digitally drawing and painting them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Photos!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 349.50px; height: 349.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 349.50px; height: 349.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 350.50px; height: 350.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 350.50px; height: 350.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">My Statement:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">This was definitely the most exciting project for me to work on. It was really fun to be able to combine two of my longest-standing interests into one project. This style of editing images has a special place in my heart. Black metal is a music genre that I&rsquo;ve been listening to since I was a teenager, and I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to the album covers. I&rsquo;ve also loved cats for as long as I can remember, and I have always loved drawing and painting them. At the time that I was working on this, I was also painting a series of similar images of cats on black metal covers, so it was nice to be able to extend that theme. Overall, I think this project has been my favorite.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Project Three</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">Video Editing</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Proposal:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">For this project, I want to explore themes of gender and one&#39;s relationship to their body, perhaps through a horror-inspired lens. Something that I think would be interesting would be to work with clips of animals and insects, with the metamorphosis of butterflies being particularly interesting to me. Perhaps I could explore the reversal and playing straight of clips featuring that theme. Maybe I could work with images of crowds to really help hone in on the perception of others and the weight that places on one&#39;s relationship to themselves and their body. Repetition and fast-paced editing could help bring a sense of urgency to this idea.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">The idea of one&#39;s relationship to themselves has been particularly interesting to me as of late, as recently my gender dysphoria has gotten a lot worse as of late. A work that sparked the idea of introspection for me was the film End of Evangelion, with the sequence of live-action clips towards the end of the film giving me ideas for how I want to structure this project. The editing is very dreamlike, which could also be interesting to explore.</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Video</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/2euGRJ1V0tU&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746583784299130&amp;usg=AOvVaw06WjoeqoMatk_XBwE1nk_i">https://youtu.be/2euGRJ1V0tU</a></span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">My Statement:</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">For this project, I used a variety of footage from old films and PSA&rsquo;s to reflect on personal experiences. It was very helpful for me to storyboard my process, as it really cut down on the amount of time and planning it took me to edit and create the final product. In future video and time-based projects, it will definitely serve me well to plan out like this, and even in traditional art media, I have found that planning my ideas out beforehand helps me feel less &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; and gives me something to work from instead of struggling to come up with ideas as I go. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">I focused on the concept of gender roles and how they feel imprisoning to me and contributing to feeling uncomfortable in my own body. I went into depth on the theme of metamorphosis and using it as a metaphor for escaping these toxic gender roles. I have found expressing my gender identity differently and not conforming to society&rsquo;s expectations of me as someone who was assigned female at birth to be very liberating, and I wanted to capture that using motifs of both metamorphosis and the human body. I used a lot of imagery from puberty informational videos to illustrate how social norms affect the perception of the body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">One thing I wish I would have done differently for this assignment was devoting more time to the actual editing process. I feel like it was very rushed as a result of leaving it until the last minute, and I wish I would have planned my time out more efficiently. Some clips are spliced in a sloppy manner, and I wish I had put a little more care and time into putting the clips together. I also feel like the project would have benefitted from adding sound, which also could have been planned out more thoroughly. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15">Project Four</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">3D Modeling</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Proposal:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">For this project, I am considering making a model out of either one of my figures or my headphones, as these are both objects that are very close to me personally. I want to make a model out of something that reflects my special interests, and i feel like it could be fun to incorporate anime or music into it somehow.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">Given the choice between any of my figures to make a model out of, I would probably choose my broken Hello Good Smile figure of Ryuko Matoi from Kill la Kill. This figure is one of the most prominent objects in my dorm, as it stands out the most on the top of my fridge. It is also much simpler to model than many other figures I have, which are sculpted in a much more detailed style. The fact that the figure&#39;s legs have broken off also gives it a sense of life and makes it seem almost battle-worn. One downside to this idea is that it may still be very complex and too difficult for me.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">If this ends up being too complex and I have too many difficulties with it, my second choice is modeling my headphones. These headphones have been my favorite pair for years, and I wear them so much that I cannot leave the house without them. I would like to model them in a resting position, as to give them a more naturalistic feel, possibly resting on the ground or another flat surface. Some textures on the headphones are a bit smooth, however, which may make them less interesting to look at.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">As for lighting, I would like to explore a dramatic lighting scheme for either of these ideas to give the image more visual interest. It will give the image much more contrast if I choose to have a stronger and more dramatic lighting source, which in turn will make it more engaging to look at.</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">My Render:</span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 694.50px; height: 391.46px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 694.50px; height: 391.46px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">My Statement:</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">I ended up going for the anime figure, obviously. This was a difficult one to do due to the complexity of the different shapes making up the figure, especially in the hair area. I wish I had also spent more time on this project, and familiarized myself with Blender just a little more. I could have also worked some color in there more and utilized the sculpting tool more instead of building several shapes on top of each other to achieve the shape that I wanted. I wish I had more experience beforehand, because I am very unfamiliar and unskilled with the Blender software. Despite this, this was a very interesting project to work on, and I enjoyed bringing one of my favorite anime characters into a project.</span></p></body></html>
